# Personal Web App

Use class time to complete a personal web app. For this assignment we will be building our own personal web page. Treat this web page as a portfolio, something to represent yourself! Basically the same format as what we created in class together, but this time make it yours and make it represent you!

The Personal Web App will need to include the following:
A header
A title heading
A subtitle heading
About me section - One Paragraph - Here you will talk about yourself, your future goals in tech!
A link to a site related to you or your work (this can be your social media i.e linkedin)
A Footer - Add a container for a small "Contact" section. Include your name email and date. I've attached a link to all of our resources, and have added some extra if you want to play around with CSS!

Remember the following topics discussed in class:
Clean code
File naming conventions
Use of accessible code
Html structure
Semantic Elements
CSS Styling

Bonus Point:
The use of CSS Class Names for styling
